# Practical Assignment

Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to build the *running application equivalent of your resume*. This message will self-destruct in 3â€¦ 2â€¦ 1â€¦

![self-destruct-mission-impossible](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/167459946-9441a9c6-bcc4-4243-893d-334097d2d1ca.gif)

### Instructions

1. Download this starter template
    - Option 1 - If you're familair with GitHub, you can clone/fork this repo and work in there.
    - Option 2 - Download the ZIP (1. Expand the green "Code" button at the top. 2. Select "Download ZIP")
2. Complete your assignment (directions below). Note: do your work in the `src/` folder.
3. Submit the assignment
    - Option 1 (GitHub). Commit the code to your fork's main branch and email the URL to your repo to Kat.
    - Option 2 (ZIP). You can zip up everything and email it to Kat (important, so that you don't have a billion GB ZIP file size, delete all the **bin** and **obj** folders before zipping it up)

> If your project needs special instructions for setup and/or use, please include those directions with your submission.

#### Project Structure

Depending on how many parts your submission has, you might be wondering how to organize it. Here's some general guidance:

- If your submission only has one solution (`.sln`) file regardless of how many projects it contains, put the sln in the `/src` folder.
    - *real world example: see my [Cat Flusher](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/Flusher) repo's `/src` folder*.
- If your submission has multiple technologies that don't work well inside the same folder, then use a sub-folder for each thing.
    - *real-world example: see my [DevOpsExamples](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/DevOpsExamples) repo's `/src` folder.*

## Assignment Guidelines

Here are the general guidelines for the assignment:

* You have complete freedom over the projectâ€™s vision and direction; this is intended for you to be able to use the platform features to show of your skills. Be creative, show your style and interest, and most importantly.. *have fun*.

* Part 1. The Main App: Choose your preferred option to build the main application ðŸš€
    * Use **Telerik UI for Blazor** (uses modern ASP.NET Core Blazor and .NET 6)
    * Use **Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX** aka Webforms (uses older-style .NET Framework)
* Part 2. Add **Telerik Reporting** to the project by creating a Report and using the HTML5 ReportViewer to display that report in the main app. This will demonstrate:
    * Your ability to use a SQL data source to render information in the Report
    * You ability to use a REST API, the Reporting REST API is already built, you only need to add it (details in documentation links below).

> Bonus points for being creative and thinking outside the box with product features. Think about different ways you can can use both the main application, as well as the Report, to... how does apple say it?..."reimagine" your resumÃ© ðŸ¤“

> Don't be frightented by the way the task initially sounds. A few of the terms I use are Telerik product-specific and will be unfamiliar to you. Your fundamental .NET experience will be more than enough to carry you through the assignment, and your ability to follow documentation will take you the rest of the way.

## Resources

Here are the resources youâ€™ll need to help implement the assignment.

### Important Note

In order to get the things oyu need to build this stuff/watch training, you will need a license for the products you chose to use. You can automatically get a trial license for any of the items above by clicking "DOWNLOAD FREE TRIAL" button on any product's Overview page. 

- [Go here for Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx), 
- [Go here for UI for Blazor](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui)
- [Go here for UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx).

Downloading the trial installer will automatically assign a new trial license to your Telerik account, and you're good to go from there. Don't hesitate to ask for assistance form Lance if you get stuck on this.
