# Practical Assignment

A private repository for submitting practical assignment.

## Instructions

1. Create a new branch for you to work on
2. Add your code to your branch, as many commits as neccessary (it would be helpful to see commits as you work, but not neccessary)
3. Open a Pull Request to merge your branch into main

> If your project needs special consideration for setup or use, you can include those instructions in your Pull Request's description

## Guidance
Depending on how many parts your submission has, you might be wondering how to organize it. Here's some general guidance:

- If your submission only has one `.sln` file (regardless of how many projects), then you can put the entire thing directly in the `/src` folder.
  - For a real-world example, see my https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/CommonHelpers repo's src folder.
- Alternatively, if your submission has multiple technologies that don't work well inside the same folder, then use a sub-folder for each separate thing.
  - For example, see my https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/DevOpsExamples repo's `/src` folder.

## Assistance

Don't be afraid to ask for assistance! Open a new Issue (on the Issues tab) to start a conversation on any related topic you need.
